            <h3>Spotifoo puts music back in the hands of the user. Our crowsourced API collects and aggregates
            music artists, songs, and albums. The API also allows for the curation of playlists. Once you're signed
            up you can add songs directly to the database and construct playlists with the available music. Through 
            crowdsourcing information, we at Spotifoo strive to build a database where all those with any musical inclination
            can share music that makes them want to belt out as if they were alone atop a mountain.
